# Node.js N-API CLI

This project eases the process of setting up an environment for developing [native Node.js modules](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v13.x/docs/api/n-api.html) by fetching the correct architecture- and OS-specific header and library files as well as preparing the `CMakeLists.txt` acxcordingly.

## Prerequisites

Currently, this tool requires `cmake` and `ninja` to be in your `PATH`, as well as a working C/C++ toolchain.

* On Windows, you can use the [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/5446351f-19f5-4b09-98c6-a4bfacc732d7/7da4388648c92544c97407c6f052fd6bc0317db407cadab9fdcb328a34d3e317/vs_BuildTools.exe) which includes all required Tools.
* On Linux or UNIX-like environments, make sure to have `cmake`, `ninja`, `clang`/`gcc` and `ld` available in your `PATH`.

## Installation

Run `npm i -g @sigma-db/napi` to install the CLI globally.

## Usage

To **create** a new project, simply run `napi new <project_name>`.
The will create a new folder `<project_name>` in the current directory, so we `cd <project_name>` into that directory.

Now we can run `napi build` to **build** the auto-generated sample project `project_name`.

To **test** that requiring that native module actually works, run `napi test`.

You should see a brief output like
> A project named `project_name` is growing here.

To **clean** any files generated during the build, run `napi clean`.
To also remove any downloaded headers and static libraries, run `napi clean all`.

## Disclaimer

I initiated this project to simplify the setup of my own native module, so don't expect it to run on *any* platform (I'm using Windows and Linux).

IÃ¤d like to see people contributing to this.
The current code was written in a single 16h session and might need some refactoring ;)
